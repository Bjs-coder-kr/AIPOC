  "score": 82,
  "feedback": "Structure and BLUF are strong, but KPI/ROI linkage is asserted rather than quantified or tied to measurable business outcomes, and the AUC section oversimplifies tradeoffs (e.g., class imbalance, thresholding). Tighten to a more consultant tone by adding concrete decision criteria, clearer KPI→model metric mapping, and a brief executive summary of impact."
